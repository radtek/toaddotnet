# Introduction #

The Toad.Net (ToadDotNet) application try to give you an easy tool to query and retrieve data from Oracle database.
It will also give you the ease to manage all objects from your database.


# Features #

At this time, only few features are offered. New features will be added (soon), depending on my spare time (unfortunately, unless someone wants to sponsor my work :)), but, bug fixing and request will be considered rapidly. So far the application allows you:
  * Connect to a database and retrieve all objects
  * Get the columns of a table
  * Get the source for functions, procedures, triggers, packages
  * Retrieve automatically data from selected table
  * Query window
  * Multilple connections
  * Syntax highighted
  * Intellisense
  * Add/drop column to/from table
  * Create/Drop indexes
  * Use of transaction

# Installation #
If you are installation the application for the first time, just double-click on the .MSI installer. If you have already installed a previous version, uninstall it, check that all file, execepted the .XML file are deleted and double-click the .MSI installer. This procedure is needed as I have some problem creating the installer, but fixing this problem is not my top priority.

# Registration #
When using the application for the first time, automatically a register form will be prompted to you. You have to enter your full name (first and last name) and a valid email address. These informations are necessary to be able to run the application. Those informations won't be given to any third party and will be use only for statistics.
