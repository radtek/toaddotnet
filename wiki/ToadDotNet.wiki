#summary Another tool for Oracle
= Introduction =

The Toad.Net (ToadDotNet) application try to give you an easy tool to query and retrieve data from Oracle database.
It will also give you the ease to manage all objects from your database.


= Features =

At this time, only very little features are offered. New features will be added (soon), depending on my spare time (unfortunately, unless someone wants to sponsor my work :)), but, bug fixing and request will be considered rapidly. So far the application allows you:
  * Connect to a database and retrieve all objects
  * Get the columns of a table
  * Retrieve automatically data from selected table
  * Query window

= Registration =
When using the application for the first time, automatically a register form will be prompted to you. You have to enter your full name (first and last name) and a valid email address. These informations are necessary to be able to run the application. Those informations won't be given to any third party and will be use only for statistics.

= Future release =
